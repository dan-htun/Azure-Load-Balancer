# Azure-Load-Balancer
![Overview](https://imgur.com/a/1pJGuZq.jpg)
In this Azure cloud project, we'll create a virtual network with two virtual machines (VMs) hosting web servers. We will set up a basic load balancer to distribute traffic across backend VMs and test its functionality. This involves:

1. **Creating a virtual network with a subnet.**
2. **Setting up two identical Virtual Machines and installing Web Server (IIS) on each.**
3. **Configuring a public load balancer with a frontend IP, backend pools, and a health probe.**

Finally, we'll perform a test to ensure the load balancer distributes traffic correctly by accessing the public frontend IP from a web browser.
