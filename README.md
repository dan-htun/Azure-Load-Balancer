# Azure-Load-Balancer
![Overview](https://i.imgur.com/wPOZXtx.jpg)

 We set up a basic load balancer to distribute traffic across two backend Virtual Machines hosting web servers and test its functionality. This involves:

1. **Creating a virtual network with a subnet.**
2. **Setting up two identical Virtual Machines and installing Web Server (IIS) on each.**
3. **Configuring a public load balancer with a frontend IP, backend pools, and a health probe.**

Finally, we'll test to see how the load balancer distributes traffic by accessing the public frontend IP from a web browser.
